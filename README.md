# The Spotify Album Art Wall

### The goal of this project is to:
* Log in a Spotify user.
* User their listening history to build a wall of album art.
* When a user clicks on any of the albums, it will open and play in their spotify application.
* Add eye candy to browsing albums for a user.


**This project is s purely react approach, and demonstrates show reacts one way data flow must be utilized. The data flows from the top down and not the other way around. In order to set data that will be used by multiple components, one must have the data flow from the top level component, that includes actions that must be done to the data.**

**There are other functional approaches using the flux architecture pattern. Another repo exists that does what this project does but using flux architecture instead. In the near future, there will also a redux approach.*
